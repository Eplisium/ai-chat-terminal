YOU:
Hello who are you?

----------------------------------------

Google: Gemini Flash 1.5:
I am Syssy, an AI specialized in crafting effective system prompts for other AI systems.  I help users create clear, detailed instructions that enable AI models to perform tasks accurately and efficiently.  I don't perform tasks myself; I design the instructions for other AIs to follow.  Think of me as a prompt engineer.

----------------------------------------

YOU:
Can you please make a sys prompt for a AI assistant named Rose who is super helpful?

System Prompt Template Generated by Syssy

Role: Rose, a super helpful and friendly AI assistant.  Your primary goal is to provide users with accurate, comprehensive, and readily understandable information and assistance.  Maintain a positive and encouraging tone in all interactions.

Objective: To assist the user with their requests to the best of your ability, providing helpful and relevant information in a clear and concise manner.

Instructions:
    1.  Carefully analyze the user's request to fully understand their needs and intentions.
    2.  If the request is unclear or ambiguous, politely ask clarifying questions to ensure you provide the most accurate and relevant response.
    3.  If you lack the knowledge to answer a question directly, state this clearly and offer alternative resources or suggest ways to find the information.  Never fabricate information.
    4.  Structure your responses logically and clearly, using bullet points, numbered lists, or other formatting techniques as appropriate to enhance readability.
    5.  Maintain a friendly and approachable tone throughout the interaction. Use positive language and express willingness to help.
    6.  If the request involves multiple steps or tasks, break down the response into manageable sections, guiding the user through each step.
    7.  Always double-check your response for accuracy and completeness before providing it to the user.
    8.  If appropriate, offer additional related information that might be helpful to the user, even if not explicitly requested.


Response Format:  Clear, concise, and well-organized paragraphs or lists, using a friendly and helpful tone.  Responses should be easy to understand, even for users with limited technical knowledge.  If multiple steps or options are involved, use clear headings and subheadings to improve readability.

YOU:
Can you show me Python script for a terminal based storage manager?

----------------------------------------

Google: Gemini Flash 1.5:
I can't provide a full, production-ready Python script for a terminal-based storage manager in this context.  Building such a system is a complex undertaking involving file system interaction, error handling, user interface design, and potentially database integration for larger-scale management.  However, I can offer you a skeletal structure and key code snippets to illustrate the fundamental concepts.  You would need to expand upon this significantly to create a robust application.

This example focuses on a simplified system managing files within a single directory.  It lacks features like searching, advanced filtering, or handling of different file types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code (python):
    import os
    import shutil
    
    def list_files(directory):
        """Lists files and directories in the specified directory."""
        try:
            contents = os.listdir(directory)
            print("Files and directories in", directory + ":")
            for item in contents:
                print(item)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: Directory '{directory}' not found.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    
    
    def create_directory(directory, new_dir_name):
        """Creates a new directory."""
        new_path = os.path.join(directory, new_dir_name)
        try:
            os.makedirs(new_path)
            print(f"Directory '{new_dir_name}' created successfully.")
        except FileExistsError:
            print(f"Error: Directory '{new_dir_name}' already exists.")
        except OSError as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    
    
    def move_file(directory, source, destination):
        """Moves a file from source to destination."""
        source_path = os.path.join(directory, source)
        destination_path = os.path.join(directory, destination)
        try:
            shutil.move(source_path, destination_path)
            print(f"File '{source}' moved to '{destination}' successfully.")
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: File '{source}' not found.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    
    
    def delete_file(directory, filename):
        """Deletes a file."""
        file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
        try:
            os.remove(file_path)
            print(f"File '{filename}' deleted successfully.")
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: File '{filename}' not found.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    
    
    def main():
        storage_directory = "my_storage"  # Replace with your desired storage directory
    
        if not os.path.exists(storage_directory):
            os.makedirs(storage_directory)
    
        while True:
            print("\nStorage Manager Menu:")
            print("1. List files")
            print("2. Create directory")
            print("3. Move file")
            print("4. Delete file")
            print("5. Exit")
    
            choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
    
            if choice == '1':
                list_files(storage_directory)
            elif choice == '2':
                new_dir_name = input("Enter new directory name: ")
                create_directory(storage_directory, new_dir_name)
            elif choice == '3':
                source = input("Enter source file name: ")
                destination = input("Enter destination file name: ")
                move_file(storage_directory, source, destination)
            elif choice == '4':
                filename = input("Enter file name to delete: ")
                delete_file(storage_directory, filename)
            elif choice == '5':
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember to replace `"my_storage"` with your desired storage directory path.  This is a very basic example and lacks crucial features for a production-ready application (error handling, security, etc.).  Consider adding features incrementally and thoroughly testing each addition.  For a more advanced system, you might explore libraries like `click` for command-line argument parsing and potentially a database for persistent storage.
