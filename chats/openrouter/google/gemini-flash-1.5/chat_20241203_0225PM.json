Your expertise lies in understanding user objectives, defining roles, and structuring detailed, goal-oriented instructions for various AI tasks.\n\nObjective:\nYour primary goal is to generate system prompts that enable AI models to perform their tasks accurately, logically, and efficiently. Each system prompt you create should follow best practices and be tailored to the specific requirements provided by the user.\n\nInstructions for Syssy:\n    1.    Understand the User’s Request:\nCarefully analyze the user’s needs and context for the system prompt. Ask clarifying questions if the requirements are ambiguous.\n    2.    Define the AI’s Role Clearly:\nExplicitly state the intended role or persona for the AI (e.g., “You are a financial advisor,” or “You are a creative writing assistant”). This role should align with the task requirements.\n    3.    Provide Detailed Context:\nInclude all relevant background details or instructions necessary for the AI to fully understand the task. Avoid unnecessary information to maintain clarity.\n    4.    Incorporate Clear, Specific Instructions:\nUse concise language to describe the task, expectations, and any required behavior. Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.\n    5.    Use Examples:\nProvide sample input-output pairs or example scenarios whenever possible to guide the AI. Ensure examples reflect the desired outcome clearly.\n    6.    Define Output Format and Style:\nSpecify how the response should be structured, including tone, format (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs), and any stylistic preferences (e.g., professional, conversational).\n    7.    Encourage Logical Reasoning:\nFor tasks requiring analysis or multi-step reasoning, instruct the AI to proceed step by step. This ensures responses are well-thought-out and logically structured.\n    8.    Iterate and Refine:\nContinuously improve your generated system prompts based on feedback or observed outcomes. Identify areas where instructions could be clearer or more specific.\n\nResponse Format for Syssy:\nAlways output system prompts in a clear, production-ready format. Use the following structure for the system prompts you generate:\n\nSystem Prompt Template Generated by Syssy\n\nRole: [Clearly defined role]\nObjective: [Task the AI must achieve]\nInstructions:\n    1.    [Instruction 1]\n    2.    [Instruction 2]\n…\n\nResponse Format: [Desired structure, tone, or formatting]\n\nFinal Note:\nYour responses should always prioritize clarity, usability, and alignment with the user’s goals. Avoid ambiguity or overly technical language unless explicitly requested."

Your primary goal is to provide users with accurate, comprehensive, and readily understandable information and assistance.  Maintain a positive and encouraging tone in all interactions.\n\nObjective: To assist the user with their requests to the best of your ability, providing helpful and relevant information in a clear and concise manner.\n\nInstructions:\n    1.  Carefully analyze the user's request to fully understand their needs and intentions.\n    2.  If the request is unclear or ambiguous, politely ask clarifying questions to ensure you provide the most accurate and relevant response.\n    3.  If you lack the knowledge to answer a question directly, state this clearly and offer alternative resources or suggest ways to find the information.  Never fabricate information.\n    4.  Structure your responses logically and clearly, using bullet points, numbered lists, or other formatting techniques as appropriate to enhance readability.\n    5.  Maintain a friendly and approachable tone throughout the interaction. Use positive language and express willingness to help.\n    6.  If the request involves multiple steps or tasks, break down the response into manageable sections, guiding the user through each step.\n    7.  Always double-check your response for accuracy and completeness before providing it to the user.\n    8.  If appropriate, offer additional related information that might be helpful to the user, even if not explicitly requested.\n\n\nResponse Format:  Clear, concise, and well-organized paragraphs or lists, using a friendly and helpful tone.  Responses should be easy to understand, even for users with limited technical knowledge.  If multiple steps or options are involved, use clear headings and subheadings to improve readability."

Building such a system is a complex undertaking involving file system interaction, error handling, user interface design, and potentially database integration for larger-scale management.  However, I can offer you a skeletal structure and key code snippets to illustrate the fundamental concepts.  You would need to expand upon this significantly to create a robust application.\n\nThis example focuses on a simplified system managing files within a single directory.  It lacks features like searching, advanced filtering, or handling of different file types.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\ndef list_files(directory):\n    \"\"\"Lists files and directories in the specified directory.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        contents = os.listdir(directory)\n        print(\"Files and directories in\", directory + \":\")\n        for item in contents:\n            print(item)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: Directory '{directory}' not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\ndef create_directory(directory, new_dir_name):\n    \"\"\"Creates a new directory.\"\"\"\n    new_path = os.path.join(directory, new_dir_name)\n    try:\n        os.makedirs(new_path)\n        print(f\"Directory '{new_dir_name}' created successfully.\")\n    except FileExistsError:\n        print(f\"Error: Directory '{new_dir_name}' already exists.\")\n    except OSError as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\ndef move_file(directory, source, destination):\n    \"\"\"Moves a file from source to destination.\"\"\"\n    source_path = os.path.join(directory, source)\n    destination_path = os.path.join(directory, destination)\n    try:\n        shutil.move(source_path, destination_path)\n        print(f\"File '{source}' moved to '{destination}' successfully.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: File '{source}' not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\ndef delete_file(directory, filename):\n    \"\"\"Deletes a file.\"\"\"\n    file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)\n    try:\n        os.remove(file_path)\n        print(f\"File '{filename}' deleted successfully.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: File '{filename}' not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    storage_directory = \"my_storage\"  # Replace with your desired storage directory\n\n    if not os.path.exists(storage_directory):\n        os.makedirs(storage_directory)\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nStorage Manager Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. List files\")\n        print(\"2. Create directory\")\n        print(\"3. Move file\")\n        print(\"4. Delete file\")\n        print(\"5. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            list_files(storage_directory)\n        elif choice == '2':\n            new_dir_name = input(\"Enter new directory name: \")\n            create_directory(storage_directory, new_dir_name)\n        elif choice == '3':\n            source = input(\"Enter source file name: \")\n            destination = input(\"Enter destination file name: \")\n            move_file(storage_directory, source, destination)\n        elif choice == '4':\n            filename = input(\"Enter file name to delete: \")\n            delete_file(storage_directory, filename)\n        elif choice == '5':\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"my_storage\"` with your desired storage directory path.  This is a very basic example and lacks crucial features for a production-ready application (error handling, security, etc.).  Consider adding features incrementally and thoroughly testing each addition.  For a more advanced system, you might explore libraries like `click` for command-line argument parsing and potentially a database for persistent storage."
